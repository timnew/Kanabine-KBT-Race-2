Kanabiner Config for KBT Race 2
===============================

This is the customized config of [Kanabiner] for KBT Race 2

Here is the list of available configs:

## KBT Race2 Group
KBT Race 2 provides some functional keys besides its "Macro" feature.
This configuration is to make them work properly on Mac

### Volume Control
* Fn + F1 to Mute Key
* Fn + F2 to Volume Down Key
* Fn + F3 to Volume Up Key

### Media Control
* Fn + F4 to Music Prev Key
* Fn + F5 to Music Play Key
* Fn + F6 to Music Next Key

**HINT:** Media Control keys works fine with iTunes.
But `Prev` and `Next` key might not work in some 3rd party apps while built-in keyboard works.

### F11 and F12
* Fn + F9 to F11
* Fn + F10 to F12

### Application to show LaunchPad
* Application Key to Display Launch Pad

**HINT:** `Application` Key is Press `Fn + X`

### Power Control
* Ctrl+Shift+Del to lock screen

**HINT:** Mac has the tradition that press `Ctrl + Shift + the key on top right corner of keyboard` to lock screen.
This configuration is to bring that feature to `KBT Race 2`, Press `Ctrl + Shift + Del` to lock screen.

## Home and End Key Group

### Home End to Line Head and Line Tail
* Home to Cmd + Left
* End to Cmd + Right

**HINT:** `Home`/`End` key navigate to the document begin/end by default on Mac. This configuration overrides the behavior, make it to line begin or line end instead of document begin and document end.
